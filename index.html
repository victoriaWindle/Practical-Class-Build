		<h2> "Kitty" Norman Tuokko </h2>

		<p> My favourite pet is my Mom's cat, Norman. He is about 6 years old and he is very needy. He likes treats and attention. He does not like my mom's bunny, Dexter. Norman is very inbred and only has one testicle but it's okay because he's very cuddly. His name is Norman because he just looked like a Norman. When Norman goes outside he likes to lay in the grass and catch butterflys. He loves to be scritched on the cheek.
